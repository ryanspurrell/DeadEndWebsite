I’m Hannah, the one who gets the pleasure of writing the political articles in the zine. I’m about to graduate with my BA in Political Science, with a Philosophy minor, at the University of Alberta, where I’ve spent far too much time reading and writing about power, relations, people, and the ideologies that shape reality. After graduation, I’ll be pursuing further education to prepare for a future where I can turn ideas into action. My goal here is to write with clarity and depth, in a way that informs readers, leaving you cranky and cynical enough to question accepted truths. I believe progress comes alive when perspectives are shared, challenged, and put into conversation with the world, and these articles offer an accessible way to translate theory into insight, and insight into something that truly resonates.
